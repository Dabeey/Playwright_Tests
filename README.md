# üìò Playwright Tests

## üöÄ Overview  
This repository contains **end-to-end automated tests** written with **Playwright**. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate browser automation and testing workflows, including:  
- Navigating websites  
- Interacting with UI elements (clicks, inputs, forms)  
- Validating expected results on a page  

Although Playwright is **JavaScript/TypeScript-first**, the concepts here directly translate into Python automation workflows (Selenium / Playwright for Python).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Playwright** (Browser automation & testing)  
- **Node.js** (Runtime for Playwright tests)  
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (Test scripting)  

---

## ‚ö° Features  
- Automates browser actions (launch, navigate, interact, close)  
- Tests basic UI interactions and workflows  
- Validates page contents for correctness  
- Easily extendable for more complex workflows

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Tests

   Run all tests:
      ```bash
       npx playwright test
      ```
   Run a specific test file:

   ```
      npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js
   ```

   Run tests in headed mode (see browser UI):
   ```
      npx playwright test --headed
   ```

## üß≠ Next Steps (Planned Improvements)

   Add Python equivalents for Playwright automation (using playwright-python)

   Integrate CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for automated test runs

   Add real-world scraping/automation examples
